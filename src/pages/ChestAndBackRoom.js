          Next up is the Chest and Back Room. At Pacific Fitness, we believe in

          testament to that commitment. Our owner, Ali, has handpicked each

          First, let’s talk about chest training. Our room boasts an impressive
          array of state-of-the-art machines and free weights, allowing you to
          challenge your chest muscles from every conceivable angle. Whether
          you’re looking to sculpt a defined chest, enhance your bench press
          strength, or increase overall upper body power, we have the perfect
          equipment for you. We have custom-made, Pacific Fitness branded
          dumbbells ranging from 2.5 kg to 50 kg as well as Smith machines,
          incline press, decline press, flat press, and fly machines.

          The centerpiece of our Chest and Back Room is the legendary Nautilus
          Pullover, a rare gem in the fitness world. There are only a handful of
          these machines left in the entire world, and we’re thrilled to be one
          of the few gyms that houses it. The Nautilus Pullover is renowned for
          its unique design, targeting the chest, upper back, and shoulders
          simultaneously, providing an unrivaled training experience. You’ll be
          able to isolate and work those muscles like never before and unlock
          hidden potential.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, let’s shift our focus to the back training section. Your back
          muscles play a crucial role in supporting overall strength and
          posture. To optimize your back workouts, we have curated an extensive
          collection of cutting-edge equipment that targets every aspect of your
          back muscles. From rowing machines, lat pulldowns, and pull-up bars to
          cable stations and hyperextension benches, you’ll find an extensive
          array of options that cater to every fitness level and training
          preference.
